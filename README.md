I added the package SAP, which includes some code that can be extended to implement Situation-Action pairs. It's quite simple at the moment, and I wasn't sure exactly which properties to use as dimensions so I picked a couple that seemed like obvious choices; however, I wasn't sure exactly how to normalize the properties so the actual distance dimensions may have a disproportionately small influence.

Additionally, I wasn't sure how we want to implement the Action part of the pairs (e.g. do we want it to use a common implementation between all intelligences, like the Goal queue we talked about earlier?) so I left that blank too.
